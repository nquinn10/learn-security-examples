Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Lack of proper authentication and authorization checks in the "./sensitive" end point.
Any client with a valid session ID can access the /sensitive endpoint, regardless of whether the
request is legitimate or not. This lack of access control makes the application vulnerable to CSRF
(Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.

Secure Version

The code sets the httpOnly flag to true in the session cookie configuration.
This prevents client-side from accessing the session cookie, making it more difficult for attackers
to steal session identifiers via XSS. sameSite attribute is also set to true, which restricts the
cookie to be sent in same-site requests only
