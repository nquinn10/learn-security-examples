Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

No verification of the userId provided. After "authenticating" the user, they can
grant themselves higher privledged or can pass in id of admin and downgrade role

There is no way to authenticate user who sent id is an admin or not

In form, can try out different ids and then just update the role as specified
Can do brute force until hitting valid id
Any user who is not admin is capable of downgrading role of admin user

In secure.js
Check whether user id is part of session or not
If user id is part of session, then can see if you can find and check if they are an admin
Still need endpoint to store user id in session
Also ensure session is assigned with secret key - if anyone changes session, hash will not match
Need to make sure cookie cannot be accessed programatically

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
Ask user to enter in user id and password - some kind of authentication (2FA in addition to session)
Can be achieved through session or having a login page - can keep them logged in with session id
