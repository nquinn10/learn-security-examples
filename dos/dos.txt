- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
There is no try/catch around find one in line 26
We are doing a find one on the id. If you try to carry out NoSQL injection on id in mongodb, it will fail
If you send it a regular expression, it is going to crash server
Attacker could crash service - DOS attack
If send in id[$ne] - will

In secure.js
We use try/catch - if something is wrong, we send a response back to specify error

Not sanitizing id because of native safeguards that mongodb has for id. Not done in secure.js
but should still sanitize inputs

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
