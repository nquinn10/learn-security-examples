Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Input is not sanitized therefore can execute any mongo query through input
Line 26
Intent is to only return object for particular user, but attacker can input mongo query to query database
Vulnerability - server doesnt account for fact that user can enter anything other than string username
Should make sure input is nothing but string input - whitelisting inputs

In Secure.js
in Line 31, removing all non-alphanumeric chars using regex
If anything is not a word or space, replace with empty space
Ensuring only usernames with alphanumeric characters are allowed

Secure with respect to info disclosure

Which CIA property does info disclosure violate?


What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
Hash the passwords stored in mongo db - currently they are stored as plain text
HTTPS to encrypt data in transit
