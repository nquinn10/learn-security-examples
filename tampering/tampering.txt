Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user input in the
 "/register" endpoint. The server reads the input provided by the user in the registration form
 'name' field and directly assigns it to the session.user without validation or sanitization.
 This allows someone to inject malicious code via the form input.

In secure.js

The secure version prevents the vulnerability by making sure the user input is sanitized and
converted using function escapeHTML(input) before being assigned to req.session.user
